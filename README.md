# system-hardening-labs

Experiments and documentation focused on **Linux system hardening**, **security boundaries**, and **attack surface reduction**, with exploratory work aligned toward **Android / AOSP security concepts**.

This repository is intended as a collection of small, well-scoped experiments rather than a monolithic toolset.

## Scope

This repository explores how security properties emerge from operating system design decisions, including:

- Permission models and access control
- Process isolation and namespaces
- Network exposure and filtering
- System defaults and hardening trade-offs

Emphasis is placed on understanding behavior rather than exploitation.
